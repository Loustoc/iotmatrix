## about the repo
There are [1281 emojis](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) in the unicode standard. I'm trying to make as many of these as possible work in the 8x8 matrix display format for imminent consumption by the [Johnny-Five robotics programming library](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five), and for eventual consumption by other systems. It's a work in progress to figure out how to make this a more efficient work in progress, but please do let me know if you want to help because you :heart: emojis :D
